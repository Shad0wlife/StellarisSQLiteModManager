# StellarisSQLiteModManager
A simple mod manager for the new Stellaris Launcher (2020), written in C# using WPF.

I wrote this mod manager because Paradox obviously changed the way the new Launcher manages its mod information. With the addition of Playsets 
(basically custom mod loadorders), Paradox kind of made a step in the right direction, but instantly stumbled on bad usability.
This mod manager may not look as fancy, but the drag and drop reordering actually works, even supports multi-selection and the window can be resized.
Oh - and you can actually export and import playsets (based on the mods' steam/pdx ID) to share them with friends for multiplayer or to just back them up 
in case you have to nuke your launcher files because mod updates are not recognized... again.

I may eventually work on optimizing performance or adding fancier features, but for now, I'm just looking forward to some feedback to see if this is actually helpful.
